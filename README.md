# Crystalline Dirac Criticality

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1116961144.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17980048)

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the numerical results presented in "Disclinations, dislocations, and emanant flux at Dirac criticality" (arXiv:2501.13866).

The code is organized into several Jupyter notebooks in the Julia language, one for each model studied in the manuscript. In these notebooks, you can find the code to 
- calculate eigenvalues of Dirac fermions under rotations and translations,
- extract topological invariants in the gapped phases,
- measure current and energy density at various critical points.
  
You will also find the code to plot the data in the style presented in the manuscript.
